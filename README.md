# 🛳️ Battleship Terminal Game

This project is a classic **Battleship** game — now playable in your terminal! This is a C++ implementation of the two-player board game where strategy, logic, and a bit of luck determine the victor. It runs entirely in the terminal and uses a Makefile for easy compilation.
I made this project for one of my cs classes!
